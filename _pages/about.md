# About Me

I am a second-year PhD student at the [Mathematics Department, ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://math.ethz.ch/), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Benny Sudakov](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~sudakovb/). My research interests lie broadly in combinatorics, particularly: 

- Ramsey Theory
- Probabilistic Methods in Combinatorics
- Algebraic Methods in Combinatorics
- Extremal Set Theory
- Theoretical Computer Science

Previously, I did my undergraduate at [ACM Honors Class](https://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/home), [Zhiyuan College](https://zhiyuan.sjtu.edu.cn/), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), where I worked with [Prof. Pinyan Lu](http://pinyanlu.com/) and [Prof. Chihao Zhang](http://chihaozhang.com/).
